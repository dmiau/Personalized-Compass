Where is Yellowstone National Park? Answering this question from a mobile search result often involves (a–b) unnecessary application switching and (b–c) repetitive zooming. (i–iii) A Personalized Compass (P-Compass) uses important points of interest to provide a first-order approximation to the answer, and can function independently or with a map. (a–c) Screenshots from a smartphone. (i–iii) Proposed P-Compass visualizations to be superimposed on the screenshots at the designated locations.
